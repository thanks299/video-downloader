This code sets up a Flask web application that allows users to download videos asynchronously using Celery with a Redis backend and logs download history in an SQLite database. Here's how it works, broken down by the key parts:

##Imports
- Os: Used to check and create a downloads directory if it doesn't exist.
- Flask, render_template, request, send_file, url_for, redirect Core components of Flask for building routes, rendering HTML templates, handling form data, and sending files.
- SQLAlchemy: Used for interacting with the SQLite database to store the download history.
- download_video_task: A Celery task for downloading videos.
- AsyncResult: To track the status of Celery tasks.
- datetime: To log the timestamp when videos are downloaded.

### Flask App Initialization
The Flask app is initialized with the SQLite database configuration (downloads. db) and SQLAlchemy is used to interact with the database.
- Database Model: download history
The DownloadHistory class defines a database model for storing information about each video download, including:
- Id: A unique ID for each download.
- Url: The URL of the video that was downloaded.
- format_choice: The format selected by the user for the download.
- file_name: The name of the downloaded file.
- Timestamp: The time when the download occurred (automatically set to the current time).
- Database Creation
- With app.app_context(), the code ensures that the application context is created before the database is initialized with db.create_all().
- Route: / (Index)
- Method: GET, POST
- Purpose: This is the main page where users can enter a URL and select the format for the video they want to download.

### POST Handling: 
When a form is submitted with a URL and format, the download_video_task function is called a Celery background task (.delay() is used to call the task asynchronously). The task ID is passed to the check_status route to track the download's progress.
- Route: /status/<task_id> (Check Status)
- Method: GET
- Purpose: This route checks the current status of the background task using the task ID passed as a URL parameter.

If the task is successful (task.state == 'SUCCESS'), it retrieves the file name of the downloaded video and sends the file to the user as an attachment.
If the task fails (task.state == 'FAILURE'), it notifies the user of the failure.
Otherwise, it informs users that the task is still in progress and asks them to wait.
After a successful download, the original URL and format are saved in the DownloadHistory table in the SQLite database.
Route: /history (Download History)
Method: GET
Purpose: This route fetches the list of all downloads from the DownloadHistory table, ordered by the timestamp (most recent first), and renders them in a history.html template.
Main Application Logic
When the app is run (if __name__ == '__main__'), it checks if the downloads folder exists. If not, it creates a storage for the downloaded videos. The Flask app then runs in debug mode (debug=True), which is useful for development.

###Key Components
- Asynchronous Task Handling with Celery:
The video download process happens in the background using Celery. The Flask app initiates the task (download_video_task.delay()) and then provides a way for users to check the status of the task.
- Database Logging:
All completed downloads are logged in the DownloadHistory SQLite database, allowing users to see their download history via the /history route.
- File Handling:
The app ensures that a downloads folder is created to store video files, and the downloaded video is sent as a file to the user when the download is complete.
- Task Lifecycle
When a user submits a URL and format on the form, the task begins processing the download in the background.
The user is redirected to the /status/<task_id> page to track the progress of the download.
Once the download is complete, the file is saved locally, logged in the database, and sent to the user for download.y
